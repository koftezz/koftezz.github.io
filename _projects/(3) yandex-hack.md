# LIRI - Let Your Favourite Artist Be Your Voice

As part of the Yandex online music hackathon, we developed LIRI with the emphasis on "social music". Liri enables music sharing within messaging applications; it is an application that makes conversations more fun and unique.
LIRI is the fastest, simplest way to search and share piece of sound chorus across all of your favorite social channels. Enjoy our powerful sound Keyboard and iMessage extensions that put LIRI at your fingertips.
Spruce up boring conversations with our LIRI sound and LIRI music libraries - exclusively available in the mobile and deskop app.
